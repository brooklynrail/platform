Hay followed an increasingly conceptual path in his work, embracing circumstance by responding to and recording his whereabouts or activities, making use of a tool or material at hand, or employing something as unpredictable as the weather.  His work reflects his state of perpetual observation and acute presence.  Hay’s latest paintings, monumentally-scaled details of the coats of four of his cats, are his first portraits, or representations of life.",

Appropriated and abstracted references to domestic spaces, gay bars, and other more provisional architectures poach key signifiers of gender- and hetero-normativity and open them onto new attachments of possibility and desire from what might seem otherwise to be static legacies. Campbell’s work is in the collections of MoMA Library and the Leslie Lohman Museum, among others, and her site-specific, bronze sculpture is permanently installed at the Lesbian Herstory Archives in Brooklyn.",

By doing so she creates an experience of eeriness, evoking a sense of both familiarity and distress. She is interested in exploring how elements associated with the domestic sphere operate as an extension of the self and reflect on one&rsquo;s heritage and gender role. Her performances reverse this dynamic and exhibit the private domestic carpet as an external masquerade both exposing and hiding fragments of the self.",

Saturated, densely worked surfaces, seemingly primordial in origin, transcend any sense of the struggle that Jensen attributes to his painting process. Defined by an amorphous, ever-changing search for resolution, Jensen’s results are ultimately determined by the act of painting itself.

Miller’s innovative work is recognized for pictorial assemblages that rely only on the flooring’s found surface, with no added paint, to render his subjects. Miller’s images range from bucolic landscapes to surrealistic, fiercely political pieces that draw on iconic news and pop culture images that have informed society’s common memory.

      "bio" : "<strong>Camille Hoffman’s</strong> practice is a ceremony of reconfiguration and critical reflection on the romantic American landscape. Considering the embedded and latent meanings around light, nature, the frontier, borders, race, gender and power in influential American landscape paintings, she uses materials collected from childhood and her everyday life to craft imaginary landscapes that are grounded in accumulation, personal narrative, and historical critique. Taking inspiration from the Philippine weaving and storytelling traditions of her ancestors, along with traditional landscape painting techniques from her academic training, she interweaves image with refuse to reveal seamless yet textured transcultural contradictions. She lives and works in New York City and teaches at The Cooper Union.",

Martin’s works attempt to deal with the psychological internalizations of spirituality and memory, using formalism in a way similar to both Alfred Jensen and Thomas Nozkowski. The artist regularly incorporates unconventional materials into his work, such as textiles, glitter, and vinyl records, as evidenced in Sweet Dreams (2nd Pillow Painting) (2009), a canvas where six affixed pillows are covered in bright neon paint.

Hart’s work is symbolist and poetic. Hart calls her work “post photography,” and has created a body of theoretic writings and exhibitions based on this concept. At SAIC, she developed a pedagogic program called Experimental 3D, and is the first art-school curriculum teaching simulations technologies in the art world. She lives in New York and Chicago, shows with Transfer and bitforms galleries and is married to Austrian media artist Kurt Hentschlager.",

Born in San Antonio, TX in 1952, she went on to receive her BFA from Carnegie Mellon University and study at both the Whitney Independent Study Program and the Art Students League in New York before rising to art world fame. Her honors include a mid-career retrospective at The Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, inclusion in multiple Venice Biennales, and the position of senior critic at the Yale University painting program.",

      "bio" : "<strong>Dike Blair</strong> (b. 1952, New Castle, Pennsylvania) uses gouache, oil, his own photographs, and strategies appropriated from Postminimalist sculpture to create intimate tableaux that transform quotidian sights and materials into exercises in formalism. A writer and teacher as well as an artist, Blair came up in the downtown scene of 1970s New York among punk rockers and Postmodernists. In the early 1980s, against prevailing art world trends toward Neo-Expressionism, he began rendering scenes from his life in gouache on paper. These ongoing diaristic paintings are devoid of human figures but nonetheless evoke the specter of the artist whose daily life plays out at a remove across their finely-wrought surfaces. Blair lives in New York and Sullivan County.",

A writer himself, Chambers draws inspiration from W.E.B. Du Bois, particularly <em>The Souls of Black Folk</em>, and one of its central themes―the veil. References to this metaphorical lens through which Black bodies are observed appear throughout his work. Chambers currently lives and works in New Haven, CT.",

      "bio" : "Los Angeles-based artist <strong>Elliott Hundley</strong> is known for expanding the traditional notions of collage and assemblage in a multidisciplinary practice of painting, drawing, sculpture, and photography that synthesizes ancient epics, futuristic narratives, and contemporary realities. Hundley leverages an abiding knowledge of classical mythology and literature to weave a fabric of allusions, informing projects such as his 2011 solo exhibition at the Wexner Center for the Arts, and took on the Ancient Greek tragedy <em>The Bacchae</em> by Euripides as its subject matter. In 2019, Hundley inaugurated the exhibition series <em>Open House</em> at MOCA, Los Angeles, exploring how the visual and material logic of collage has informed artists in MOCA’s collection, as well as his own practice.",

Emerging from a series of performances in a haphazardly built East Village loft, evil dentist centers on the notion that performance and place-making are intertwined, politicized acts of care. Curatorially operating at the fringes of experimental, pop, and rave music, evil dentist programs eclectic performances that challenge artists to rethink how they connect to their audience.",

Her Flintstonian tactility and penchant for scale compressions reveal an unlikely collision of private and public, where intimate moments also serve as social ruptures. Her work has been exhibited at The Kitchen, Art in General, and many other galleries. Krieger is a 2019 Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Award Fellow, and has received many additional grants. She serves as Program Director at The Keith Haring Foundation, Consultant for the Berlin-based MFA &amp; PhD program Transart Institute, and Adjunct Faculty at Adelphi University and Watkins College of Art.

Solmi uses his art as a vehicle to stimulate a visceral conversation with his audience, highlighting the  contradictions and fallibility that characterize our time.

These scenarios take place inside the white cube, which functions as a pedestal, an attempt to blur the boundaries between sculpture and world and between the artwork and the viewer.

Raised in Texas and trained as an architect, his work arises from a deep connection to nature and its organic materials. By transforming familiar objects to challenge human perception, Hayden investigates how we view ourselves and our surroundings. He utilizes wood as his primary medium, frequently loaded with multi-layered histories in their origin, including objects as varied as discarded trunks, rare indigenous timber, Christmas trees, or souvenir African sculptures. Hayden’s work questions the stasis of social dynamics and asks the viewer to examine their place within an ever-shifting ecosystem.",

His approach is instinctive and physical, often working on the floor, sanding, hammering and torching his materials until a total metamorphosis takes place.

Adopting the idea of art-as-process, she turned from painting and sculpture to performance art. In the early 70s, her work became increasingly symbolic, gamelike, and ritualistic. By the 80s, she began to create complex, nonlinear narratives premised on literary and historical texts, including science-fiction, medieval Icelandic sagas, and, more recently, the writings and biography of the art historian Aby Warburg. Her most recent work explores the relationship between new digital media and performance in multichannel video installations.",

The result is seemingly realistic but artificial in actuality. Such virtual technology has become standard in the videogames industry, which evolved from US military simulation exercises; yet it has rarely crossed over into the visual arts.",

In 1978, he began to make Plate Paintings, imagic works with sculptural surfaces produced by layering shards of broken dishes with thick applications of auto body putty, dental plaster, and oil paint on wooden structures. His unorthodox, highly experimental approach to use of materials, gestures, and form and large scale and shaped paintings have blurred the distinction between abstraction and figuration. Throughout his practice, he sustained the use of objet trouvé and chance-based processes, transforming painting and opening the door for new generations of young painters today.",

In 1972, Komar and Melamid founded Sots Art - conceptual eclectic art based on cliches of the Soviet propaganda and the world&rsquo;s art history. In 1974 their works, made in collaboration, were destroyed by the Soviet authorities during the disbanded &ldquo;Bulldozer Exhibition&rdquo; - the unofficial artists&rsquo; group show. In 1976 their works were smuggled out to New York and had a successful show at Ronald Feldman Gallery. Komar &amp; Melamid have lived in New York since 1978 and participated in numerous international exhibitions, including Documenta, Kassel and Venice Biennale. In 2003, Komar and Melamid ended their collaboration and they have been working individually.",

While Pittman’s early works were informed by the socio-political struggle resulting from the peak of the AIDS epidemic, racial discord, and LGBTQ+ civil rights struggles that defined the last two decades of the 20th century, his later paintings evince a shift in focus towards interior spaces, including domestic and psychological subjects.",

With the means at hand and conserving the traces of her process, Catunda’s “soft world” insinuates a critique of the affirmation of identity through consumerism, reworking textile waste and the mechanisms of commercial culture. In her career she has participated in three São Paulo Biennials (1983, 1985 and 1994) and large collective exhibitions such as Modernity (Paris, 1987), Latin American Artists of the 20th Century (Museum of Modern Art in New York, 1993), and elsewhere.",

      "bio" : "Artist <strong>Mark Dion</strong>’s work examines the way dominant ideologies and public institutions shape our understandings of history, knowledge, and the natural world. The job of the artist, he says, is to go against the grain of dominant culture, to challenge perception and convention. Appropriating archaeological, field ecology and other scientific methods of collecting, ordering, and exhibiting objects, Dion creates works that question the distinctions between ‘objective’ (‘rational’) scientific methods and ‘subjective’ (‘irrational’) influences. Dions holds a BFA and an honorary doctorate from the University of Hartford School of Art, Connecticut. He is a cofounder and co-director of Mildred&rsquo;s Lane. He was born in New Bedford, MA in 1961.",

Natural materials of wool, silk, and dye are worked by hand, each resulting piece having undergone an immaterial transfer of energy through Tuttle’s physical and meditative touch. The artist’s relationship to materiality is revealed further by the inclusion of small “stones,” both actual and cast polished metal, and of fabricated steel weights. These elements add another layer of visual incident and mark-making, to further open a dialogue of possibility and substance, light, and weight. Overall, the unification of immaterial energy with material form results in constructed canvases and loosely hanging paintings that vibrate with a felt, unseen force.",

Staged vignettes rife with symbolism, their landscapes are inhabited by figures, in Oliver’s words, “grappling with their varied situations as Black adventurers”—fishing, running, swimming, on the lookout for threats both worldly and otherworldly, moving through portals to hidden dimensions. These characters explore faraway lands that exist somewhere between imagination and reality, occupying scenes that blend elements of the artist’s everyday life with a dizzying array of objects, creatures, and plants from around the world. Inspired by Black art history, speculative science fiction, and cosmic jazz, Oliver layers references into elaborate narratives writ large in oil.",

Spanjer strives to confront his own sensitivity in his work. The research is often based on self-evaluation: trying to dismantle narratives that have been planted and may still be growing. Whilst challenging an internalized belief system, Spanjer equally tries to pull apart generic ideas on ‘blackness’ and black men within the art world and what an artist who is black should display or talk about within their work. The theme of resistance is often a framework he tries to build or begin to build a workaround.",

Jones explores a sense of self as a visual, visceral experience.The figures in her work are notably abstracted and Jones uses bold color, competing forms, and an interplay of textures to communicate her ideas to viewers, who bring their own experiences and cultural backgrounds to the interpretation of her works. This sense of community and shared history comes to the fore in her installations and performances, in which imagery, sound, and music coalesce in a celebration of Black culture. Jones’s work has been exhibited at institutions such as the Long Museum Shanghai and Chisenhale Gallery, London. She lives and works in London.",

      "bio" : "Raha Raissnia learned to paint from filmmakers and musicians rather than painters. Years spent at Anthology Film Archives left her well-versed in the cinematic avant-garde, and her projection performances often involve collaborations with experimental musicians Aki Onda and Charles Curtis. Above all, Raissnia’s work aspires to the temporal and experiential condition of music—suggestive, ambiguous, abstract. Over the past decade, the artist’s paintings, drawings, and films have unfolded within a permutational, self- reflexive structure. In her earlier work, the artist presented dense, architectonic black and white drawings and paintings that appeared to echo a certain postwar European abstraction.",

She creates a subversive aesthetic that counteracts antiquated, oppressive discourse, and acts as a restorative force through which people can move outdated, repressive modes of being towards reclaiming their power.",

Smith emerged in the 1980s and continues to produce exuberant paintings and sculptures characterized by an inimitable style and subject matter that reflect his bi-cultural American and Mexican heritage. Contorted and morphed figures recur throughout his work, in a hybrid that draws from his early studies of fresco painting with traditional practitioners in Mexico, and an indebtedness to Picasso, the Surrealists, and the politically daring Mexican muralists. Through these varied beings, Smith reflects upon the complexities and absurdities of society, family, politics, culture, war, and the human condition itself, framed by birth and death.",

He studied fresco painting with traditional craftsmen in Mexico, attended art academies in Mexico and the United States, and settled in Mexico City. Since 1985, he has divided his time between New York and Cuernavaca, Mexico. Smith’s work is characterized by a unique kind of magical realism. He bends, twists, and transplants, creating illogical scenarios that are full of surprises and special effects. The artist often uses dogs and animals as anthropomorphic beings. “They are an entity of the human figure,” says Smith. “They are beasts, but they are directly attached to a blueprint of our own existence.”",

      "bio" : "Rontherin Ratliff is a mixed media sculptor whose work focuses on ideas of balance and the human condition. He blends functionality, aesthetic, context, and associations to address subjects of loneliness, loss, homesickness, memory, and the burdens we carry. Ratliff examines the metaphor of the body as a house where the mind dwells. Feeling at home or in harmony within including home as one&rsquo;s origin or domestic place. The work questions the sociocultural constructed concepts of self. With it, he contemplates reservations regarding home as a safe-haven where one experiences positive qualities such as security and comfort. Using architectural materials and domestic objects, his work explores the notion of internal versus external balance.",

Her first survey exhibition Blue Hills, Yellow Tree, opened in 2019 at Pioneer Works in Brooklyn, NY. She has also participated in exhibitions at venues including Jeffrey Deitch, the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum, White Columns, and many others.",

      "bio" : "One of the great innovators in postwar American painting. He emerged from the Washington, D.C. scene in the mid 1960s with works that elaborated upon and disrupted the ethos of Color School painting. A series of formal breakthroughs resulted in his canonical Drape paintings, which expanded upon the tenets of Abstract Expressionism in entirely new ways. Suspending stretcherless lengths of painted canvas from the walls or ceilings, Gilliam transformed his medium and the contexts in which it was viewed. As an African-American artist in the nation’s capital at the height of the Civil Rights Movement, this was not merely an aesthetic proposition; it was a way of defining art’s role in a society undergoing dramatic change.",

Her practice has evolved from its more conceptual and process-based origins to address formal and theoretical issues regarding the construct of painting. Examining traditional roles of painting and sculpture, Moyer reframes the painted surface as a sculptural field in which fragments of previously used stone are paired with hand-painted canvas to create dynamic compositions. She manipulates these found textures and materials into powerful and evocative abstract works that evince beauty, humor, balance and chance, employing the hand-made and readymade.",

His recent series <em>Chimeras</em> creates hybridized forms that transpose, combine, and juxtapose classical and historical subjects to create alternative meanings and produce what he calls “future ethnographies.” As creative director and keyboardist, he fronts Moon Medicin, a multimedia concept band that straddles visual art and music performances.",

Kantarovsky’s figurative paintings contain drastic shifts in scale, paint application, and stylization. Similarly, the artist probes his art historical predecessors: both canonical and relatively unknown painters, writers, and illustrators. The presence of these muses, which dot Kantarovsky’s compositions, simultaneously questions and indulges in a lineage of painterly impulses.",

In her search for a mode of image making that accommodates immediacy and spontaneity, Crowner creates graphic compositions that discretely test the boundaries of abstract painting while also engaging and reshaping its art historical legacy. From afar, the bold geometric forms, clean lines, and elegant arabesques inhabiting her canvases conjure the pristine visual fields of geometric abstraction. On closer viewing, the presence of stitches and seams reveals a craft-oriented methodology in which raw and painted segments of canvas are cut, rearranged, and sewn together using the process-based logic of collage.",

Sean Scully is known for rich, painterly abstractions in which stripes or blocks of layered color are a prevailing motif. The delineated geometry of his work provides structure for an expressive, physical rendering of color, light, and texture. Scully’s simplification of his compositions and use of repetitive forms—squares, rectangles, bands—echoes architectural motifs (doors, windows, walls) and in this way appeals to a universal understanding and temporal navigation of the picture plane. However, the intimacy of Scully’s process, in which he layers and manipulates paint with varying brushstrokes and sensibilities, results in a highly sensual and tactile materiality.",

Her media-spanning oeuvre draws on a range of influences including free jazz and spoken word, Yoruba mythology, Japanese art and theater, Brazilian Constructivism, and African ritual.

      "bio" : "Video and installation artist <strong>Shirin Neshat</strong> explores the political and social conditions of Iranian and Muslim life in her works, particularly focusing on women and feminist issues. Neshat was born in Qazvin, Iran, and left the country to study art in the US at 17; she graduated from the UC Berkeley in 1982. When she returned to her home in 1990, she found it barely recognizable from before the 1979 Revolution, a shocking experience that incited the meditations on memory, loss, and contemporary life in Iran that are central to her work. Her Women of Allah series introduced the hallmark themes of her pieces through which she examines conditions of male, female, public, private, religious, political, and secular identities in both Iranian and Western cultures.",

Extending his commitment to a painting practice, he began to seek alternative ways to amplify public engagement around his art, partnering with institutions, municipalities, and even the US Postal Service to reach new audiences. Throughout his artistic career, Locke’s practice has questioned how we ascribe meaning to portraiture and pushes viewers to confront and critically engage with a complicated present and painful past.",

Sanzgiri’s films offer sonic and visual journeys through family history, local mythology, and colonial legacies of extraction in Goa, India—where his family originates—deftly utilizing and vividly blending together 3D renderings, drone videography, photogrammetry and lidar scanning, 16 mm film and animation, archival footage, and desktop documentary practices. Sanzgiri’s work has been screened extensively at festivals and venues around the world and is the recipient of numerous awards.",

Vernon earned her BFA at The Cooper Union, New York. Recent exhibitions include 125 Newbury, New York; Luce Gallery, Turin; Deli Gallery, New York, and Sargent’s Daughter’s, Los Angeles.

Since the mid-1980s, figuration has been a central concern for the artist; his use of figure and representation of the body coincided with a general return to the themes of narrative and allegory in art in the 1980s—a period in which theatricality was a prevalent political, social, and cultural mode. Schütte’s works present what the artist has referred to as “the grammar of character,” as opposed to a mere representation of the psychological. His current exhibition at Peter Freeman, Inc. is on view through November 6, 2021.",

      "bio" : "A painter whose compositions address the continuity of movement, climate change, infrastructure, and architecture, <strong>Torkwase Dyson</strong> grapples with ways space is perceived and negotiated by black and brown bodies. These subjects produce abstractions that explore the history and future of black spatial liberation strategies and environmental racism. Explorations of how the body unifies, balances, and arranges itself to move through environments become expressive and discursive structures within her work. Dyson builds the paintings slowly, accumulating washes and configuring geometric elements through improvisation and reflection. The subtle use of atmospheric color, lines, and scale in the paintings invites the eye to consider the conceptual and corporeal knowledge of space in real time.",

Her signature abstract shapes refer to things in the real world — vessels, bowls, tools, and other objects — each revealing the mark of the human hand while also summoning natural forms and forces. In recent years, von Rydingsvard has explored other mediums in depth, such as bronze, paper, and resin, continuing to expand upon her unique artistic vocabulary.",

Her paintings take shape through a process of layering and accumulation, combining oil media with various found and unconventional materials. The resulting objects hover between painting and sculptural relief, with layers that frequently extend onto the sides and supports of the canvas, refusing any definitive boundary. Within these stratified compositions, Baras creates symbolic topographies which address ideas of language, migration, and translation. She has exhibited her work widely throughout the U.S. and internationally, and is the recipient of recognitions including, the Pollock-Krasner grant (2023) and the Guggenheim Fellowship (2019).",

Full of phantoms, demons, and other spectral characters, Ji’s paintings have frequently functioned as metaphorical critiques of oppressive power structures—and strategies of defiance.
