# The Brooklyn Rail Studio

https://studio.brooklynrail.org

## Getting Started

To run the Brooklyn Rail Studio project locally on your computer, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository https://github.com/brooklynrail/studio.git
2. Install the Docker Desktop App https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
3. Open Docker
4. In the terminal, run `docker compose up --build` -- this will take 3-4 mins while it builds the docker images from scratch, and installs the current schema. If the images are already built, you can start the container by running `docker compose up`.
5. Visit http://localhost:8055
